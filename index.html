    <p>Hi! I'm Herman Chau who competed in many puzzle hunts with the team Black Fedora Group.
       I've written some resources to help new puzzle hunters quickly get up to speed on the types
       of puzzles they might encounter in a puzzle hunt and I've also authored a number of puzzle hunts.</p>
    <p>On this site you'll find the documents I've written for both new puzzle hunters and to record mistakes
       that we (Black Fedora Group) have made in past hunts. You'll also find puzzles I've written and their corresponding
       solutions here.</p>

          A Chrome extension I wrote that aids in identifying images in puzzlehunts. The primary feature that distinguishes this from
          other methods of reverse image searching is the ability to easily crop out a section of an image to search. This lets you
          reverse image search pdfs, videos, or composited images.
